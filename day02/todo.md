rushed it and can totally optimise it and make it better

Would like to make it more generic in the usage (should be able to add / remove another move)

Should update the consts/functions names and solve things like get rid of the pop() or the nested blocks (try to nest max 1).
Have ideas for a gui and someday and why not a 1V1 real game where players could "program" their own strats could be fun
